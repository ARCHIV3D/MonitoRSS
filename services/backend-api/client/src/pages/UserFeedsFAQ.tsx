              <Text>
                Personal feeds are a new type of feed that will replace current (now considered
                &quot;legacy&quot;) feeds. They are named &quot;personal&quot; because they are tied
                to your account rather than a server, so all the feeds you see are only the ones you
                have personally created.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                They address core infrastructure/stability issues related to legacy feeds and are
                more reliable, customizeable and flexible than the current feeds that you have. New
                feature development will only happen for personal feeds from this point onward. Some
                of its new features are listed below:

                          Legacy feeds were not scalable in terms of new feature development and
                          maintenance. As a result, a significant portion of time was spent on
                          maintaining and trying to scale infrastructure rather than developing new
                          features. Features also had to be disabled to lessen the load on the bot
                          to prioritize article delivery.

                          These issues should be resolved now since feeds were re-designed from the
                          ground up. Feature development should be faster and easier, and there
                          should be less frequent failures.
